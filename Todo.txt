Important:

Calendar Table Design rework
Task edit pages Rework
Better Site Navigation
Forum?
PM-System
User Settings
New + better Test Cases

Fixes:

Nice-To-Have:
Task edit - option for relative/absolute intervall (relative counts intervall from todays date when finished, absolute from the original date of the task)
Admin Console - needs more work -> promote other users to admin
bug report system
Polish home a bit


more or less done:
Rework welcome/home page with News blog system
More Flexible regexp for groups and Tasks

Done:
Task edit - first User to do it (or random) : default should be the creator or next in line if not a new task
